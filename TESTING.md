# Testing

## Code Validation

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

My page is showing no errors, but is showing 1 warning, with the use of the "-webkit" vendor extension style I have opted to use to work around an issue I was facing.

### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files.
