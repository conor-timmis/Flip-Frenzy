## Code Validation

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

My page is showing no errors, but is showing 1 warning, with the use of the "-webkit" vendor extension style I have opted to use to work around an issue I was facing.

### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files.
