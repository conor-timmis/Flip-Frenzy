# [FLIP FRENZY](https://conor-timmis.github.io/Flip-Frenzy)

Welcome to Flip Frenzy. My page is dedicated to your usual memory card flip game, but with a slight twist featuring a 16-bit theme. I have chosen this game to rebuild because I would like to capture a time I enjoyed when I was younger and could play this for hours. The reason I have chosen a 16-bit theme is to make it clean but also nostalgic in a sense, I thought this would be a nice touch as someone that used to enjoy games even when they were graphically inferior. 

My target is for anyone who wants to enjoy a free game that wants to try something fun and simple, no setup needed. They should want to reflect a bit subconsciously in the old graphics I've used also though, it's not entirely necessary to do it or want to do it, mainly for some food for thought. I think this will be a good way to unwind and move away from the stresses of work you may have on a daily basis, and the fact it is themed around nostalgia could be refreshing to many people. You truly don't need to be a gamer or even close to lose yourself in Flip Frenzy for a while!
