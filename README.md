# [FLIP FRENZY](https://conor-timmis.github.io/Flip-Frenzy)

Welcome to Flip Frenzy. My page is dedicated to your usual memory card flip game, but with a slight twist featuring a 16-bit theme. I have chosen this game to rebuild because I would like to capture a time I enjoyed when I was younger and could play this for hours. The reason I have chosen a 16-bit theme is to make it clean but also nostalgic in a sense, I thought this would be a nice touch as someone that used to enjoy games even when they were graphically inferior. 

My target is for anyone who wants to enjoy a free game that wants to try something fun and simple, no setup needed. They should want to reflect a bit subconsciously in the old graphics I've used also though, it's not entirely necessary to do it or want to do it, mainly for some food for thought. I think this will be a good way to unwind and move away from the stresses of work you may have on a daily basis, and the fact it is themed around nostalgia could be refreshing to many people. You truly don't need to be a gamer or even close to lose yourself in Flip Frenzy for a while!

## UX


In this section, I'll talk about how the design process went for Flip Frenzy. I originally wanted to create a memory card flip game, but as I found different ones and looked at how they were approaching it, I realised that I would prefer if it was more traditional with how it appears, some looked too modern to fit how I'm used to seeing it. I used to play a version on the Nintendo DS, and the Super Mario Bros game for it came with a memory card flip game that I can remember clearly, casino themed with traditional cards except they had the characters on them instead. I went with a more oldschool feel for the game for nostalgia and decided to go with 16-bit assets to fit the theme a bit more. I didn't want to make the game "look" too crazy in case it threw people off and caused any confusion, as it's supposed to be a simple game with a simple goal, but with a lot of fun. The game mechanics involved are basic but can easily be enjoyed regardless with replayability on top.
